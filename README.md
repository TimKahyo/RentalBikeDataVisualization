HOW TO OPERATE
==
There are 2 main file here that you can run, <b>dashboard/dashboard.py</b> and <b>notebook</b>.ipynb.

The only thing that you need to do is to change the data file location or path.

- The dashboard uses <b>dashboard/merged.csv</b>.

- The <b>notebook.ipynb</b> uses <b>data/day.csv</b> and <b>hour.csv</b>. But it's <b>already runned previously</b> so you might not need to change the change anything, except if you wish to run it in your own machine/google colab.
